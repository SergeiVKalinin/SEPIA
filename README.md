### What to Expect
SEPIA is intended to be a tool that enhances the collaboration between statisticians
and domain scientists who are using computational models to augment observations in
R&D and engineering applications. The code and the methodology 
it implements can be demonstrated simply, but new R&D often raises issues in 
analysis that are subtle and complicated. SEPIA has many options to address issues 
that have come up in the development team's experience in scientific applications,
and it is available to be extended to address new application requirements. We 
recommend the domain scientist consult or partner with a statistician familiar with the
methodology to ensure best outcomes. 

### Documentation
Current documentation is at [Read the Docs](http://sepia-lanl.readthedocs.io).
The documentation contains a workflow guide that is helpful for new users to read, and also contains a quick reference for basic commands as well as an API.

### Examples
Basic usage is demonstrated in the Examples directory. 
After looking at the documentation, check out the examples.

### Install package 
For cleaner package management and to avoid conflicts between different versions of packages,
we recommend installing inside an Anaconda or pip environment.
However, this is not required.

First, pull down the current source code from either by downloading a zip file or using `git clone`.

From the command line, while in the main SEPIA directory, use the following command to install sepia::

        pip install -e .[sepia]

The `-e` flag signals developer mode, meaning that if you update the code from Github, your installation will automatically
take those changes into account without requiring re-installation.
Some other essential packages used in SEPIA may be installed if they do not exist in your system or environment.

If you encounter problems with the above install method, you may try to install dependencies manually before installing SEPIA.
First, ensure you have a recent version of Python (greater than 3.5).
Then, install packages `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, and `tqdm`.
