### Example notebooks

The example notebooks demonstrate various use cases.
For a fast orientation, use `Synthetic_toy_examples/univariate_example.ipynb` or 
`Synthetic_toy_examples/multivariate_example_with_prediction.ipynb` for handling multivariate-output data.
The directories are described below; each has its own README with more information.

#### `Al_5083/`
Real data example with multivariate output. Data comprised of features extracted from velocimetry curves in a 
flyer plate impact experiment.

#### `Ball_Drop/`
Synthetic data example with multivariate output from a physically motivated model of dropping balls from a tower.

#### `Neddermeyer/`
Synthetic data with 2D multivariate output from a physically motivated model.
Demonstrates custom code for 2D outputs.

#### `Synthetic_toy_examples/`
Synthetic data toy examples. Used to explain basic ideas and show syntax, but results not particularly meaningful.

#### `linear_response_example/`
Discussion of why a linear emulator is a special case, and how to set up a case when the simulations are known to be linear in response.

#### `observation_error_example/`
Demonstration of including observation error in a simple case, discussion of observation error scaling in sepia.
